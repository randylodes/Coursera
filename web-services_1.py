# Sending data over the Web in a common "wire format"
# serialize/de-serialize formats:
# XML is older, more complex nad rigorous 
# JSON is more modern, lightweight 

# XML - "Extensible Markup Language"
# XML gained popularity with HTML; has similar "tags" 
# "Elements" or "Nodes" 
# simple element: <name>Chuck</name>
# complex element has nested "child" nodes
# start tag, end tag, text content, attribute, self-cloxing tag
# <email hide="yes"/>
# visualizing XML as a "Tree" with "Nodes" and "Attributes"
# .. or as "Paths" a/b/c, similar to folders on a computer

# XML "Schema" is an agreement on what the XML should look like
# or a "contract" describing "legal format" of the data for "validation"
# in the early 90's, there were many schema languages in existence 
# (DTD) Document Type Definition
# (SGML) Standard Generalized Markup Language
# (XSD) XML Schema from W3C <<=== this is most common today

# XSD structure and constraints - # occurences, data types, enumerations
# the commonly accepted date format is YYYY-MM-DD
# ISO 8601 Date/Time Format - 2002-05-30T09:30:10Z
# typically specified in UTC/GMT rather than local time
